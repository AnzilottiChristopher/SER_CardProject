# SER_CardProject
This is the final project that is going to be based on the card game Egyptian Rat-Screw (modified)

To run our program go to the EgyptianRatScrew file and follow the following instructions.
   
  -If running on eclipse: right click and click green button labeled run
   
  -If running on VSCode: click sideways triangle in the top right corner 
  
  -If running through terminal use following commands
    -javac EgyptianRatScrew.java
    -java EgyptianRatScrew
    
Playing the Game:
  After running the game the terminal will ask you a few questions for button inputs
  After answering the questions a popup will appear click on it
  This popup will be where you input your button inputs 
  Player 1 will begin by placing one of his cards
  Each player will then go back and forth placing cards
  When a sandwich (2,3,2) or double (8,8) appears the users will then have to press their chosen button before the 
  other players to gain the middle pile that's been building up
  When a face card appears (J, Q, K, A), the attacked player has to play 1-4 cards depending on which face (J = 1, Q = 2, K = 3, A = 4)
  If the attacked player doesn't respond with a face card the attacking player gains the middle pile
  If there is a sandwich or double while someone's being attacked either player can still slap and gain the middle pile
